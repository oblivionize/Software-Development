How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    
    I like to interpret user needs by creating user stories. User stories involve writing down what the customer wants and how I can achieve this. This is a         really great way to organizes your thoughts and in a team setting it can help to keep everyone on the same page.
    
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    
    I follow an agile approach when writing my programs. I tend to code small segments at a time with a lot of testing to make sure each segment works. I don't     really like to code the whole project at once and then test. I find it harder to find bugs in the code when I have to go through a lot of code.
    
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  
    To be a good team member anywhere all comes down to how well you can communicate with others. Without communication work can be hard to get done, especially     on large projects that require a team. The better you work with others the better the final project will be.
